# 9. Integrate and adapt technology

New technological solutions must integrate seamlessly with existing systems, processes and infrastructure. Careful integration reduces complexity, increases acceptance and maximizes the value of both new and existing investments.

## Why is it important?

- **Continuity**: Avoid disruption of critical services
- **Cost effectiveness**: Exploit existing investments
- **User experience**: Create a coherent experience for end users
- **Data streams**: Ensure consistent and reliable data exchange
- **Complexity reduction**: Reduce the management burden of fragmented systems
- **Risk reduction**: Lower the risk of project failure through gradual implementation

Careful integration and adaptation of technology allows you to create a coherent and effective digital landscape that delivers value to users and organisations, while respecting existing investments and supporting future innovation.

### Integration approach

1. **Know your landscape**: List existing systems, processes and data flows
2. **Identification Integration Points**: Determine where to connect new systems
3. **Evaluate Impact**: Assess the impact of changes on the whole
4. **Choose appropriate cartridges**: Select the right integration methods and technologies
5. **Plan phased**: Implement changes gradually to reduce risks
6. **Test end-to-end**: Validate full integration, not just individual components
7. **Monitor performance**: Continue monitoring integration points for effectiveness and efficiency

### Integration patterns and technologies

- **APIs**: Application Programming Interfaces for structured data exchange
- **Middleware**: Software that connects different applications
- **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)**: Central communication channel between systems
- **Microservices**: Modular architecture supporting flexible integration
- **ETL processes**: Extract, Transform, Load for data movements
- **Event-driven architecture**: Systems communicate through events
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of on-premise and cloud solutions

### Challenges and solutions

- **Legacy systems**: Develop adaptors or wrappers for older technology
- **Data formats**: Use standards and transformations for compatibility
- **Different speeds**: Implement bimodal IT to balance innovation and stability
- **Security limits**: Develop safe integration points between different security zones
- **Organizational silos**: Promote cooperation between departments and teams

### Best practices for successful integration

- **Common standards**: Promote the use of open standards
- **Loose coupling**: Minimize direct dependencies between systems
- **Documentation**: Keep architectural diagrams and integration points up-to-date
- **Testing and monitoring**: Regularly check integration points for operation
- **Government**: Develop guidelines for adding new systems
- **Change management**: Coordinate changes across multiple systems

### Future resilience considerations

- Provide expandability for future integrations
- Document interfaces and data models thoroughly
- Develop migration and phasing-out strategies
- Continue to follow open standards for long-term compatibility
- Regularly evaluate the technology landscape for efficiency and effectiveness
