# 14. Meet the service standard

The Service Standard defines what citizens and businesses can expect from public services. It ensures that digital services are user-friendly, accessible and reliable, regardless of what government organisation they offer.

## Why is it important?

- **Consistent user experience**: Ensures a uniform experience in all administrations
- **Quality assurance**: Guarantees minimum quality and usability
- **Efficiency**: Prevents waste from poorly designed services
- **Inclusion**: Ensures that services are accessible to all
- **Trust**: Strengthens citizens' confidence in digital public services
- **Continuous improvement**: Encourages continuous improvement of services

By meeting the service standard, government organisations provide services that are efficient, user-friendly and inclusive, leading to higher user satisfaction, lower costs and better results for society.

#### 1. Understand your users and their needs

- Explore who your users are and what they want to achieve
- Validate assumptions with user research
- Continue collecting and processing user feedback

#### 2. Solve whole problems

- Focus on the full user journey, not just the digital part
- Work across organisational boundaries
- Avoid isolated solutions that do not fit in the wider context

#### 3. Provide a multidisciplinary team

- Bring together different expertises (design, development, policy, etc.)
- Ensure direct involvement of all necessary disciplines
- Encourage close cooperation instead of sequential transfer

#### 4. Create and iterate with users

- Develop services incrementally
- Test early and often with real users
- Improve continuously based on feedback and usage

#### 5. Ensure inclusion

- Create services accessible to all
- Consider different skills, devices and conditions
- Provide alternatives for users who cannot use the digital service

#### 6. Use of proven methods and technologies

- Follow best practices and standards
- Use existing proven components
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or experimental technologies

#### 7. Operation reliable and safe

- Build robust, reliable services
- Implement appropriate security measures
- Ensure transparency about data usage and privacy

### The assessment process

- **Self Evaluation**: Rate your own service using the standard
- **Independent review**: Have your service evaluated by experts
- **Continuous improvement**: Use reviews to improve services
- **Publication of results**: Transparency on how services perform

### Implementation in practice

- Start with the service standard from the start of the project
- Document how to meet the default
- Use assessments as learning moments, not just as checkpoints
- Share experiences and lessons within and outside your organisation
- Build a culture of user orientation and continuous improvement

### Challenges and solutions

- **Legacy systems**: Develop a gradual improvement strategy
- **Organisational boundaries**: Promote cooperation between departments
- **Limited resources**: Focus on the most critical aspects first
- **Change Management**: Invest in culture change and training
- **Complex regulation**: Translate complexity into user-friendly experiences
